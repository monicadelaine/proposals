abstract = {The paper presents a simple moving obstacle detection method which used the residual error calculated in uses of focus of expansion (FOE) estimation. Method can be applied to many industrial tasks such as an intelligent machine surveillance system or an obstacle detection system for an autonomous vehicle system. First, the optical flow field is extracted from sequence of dynamic imaged captured by a fixed camera on a moving observer. Next, the FOE is estimated in local image regions. Its residual error is first calculated in the region. An image region corresponding to the block is added with the residual error. This process is repeated by sliding and adding for the local region, and changing the size of the local region. Finally, regions which have high residual error values are detected as candidate regions of moving obstacles. Experimental results using real outdoor scenes show the effectiveness of the proposed method ,URL},

@article{Iyengar1990,
abstract = {The navigation of autonomous mobile machines, which are referred to as robots, through unknown terrains, i.e., terrains whose models are not a priori known is considered. We deal with point-sized robots in two- and three-dimensional terrains and circular robots in two-dimensional terrains. The two-dimensional (three-dimensional) terrains are finite-sized and populated by an unknown, hut, finite, number of simple polygonal (polyhedral) obstacles. The robot is equipped with a sensor system that detects all vertices and edges that are visible from its present location. In this context, the work deals with two basic navigational problems. In the visit problem, the robot is required to visit a sequence of destination points, in a specified order, using the sensor system. In the terrain model acquisition problem, the robot is required to acquire the complete model of the terrain hy exploring the terrain with the sensor. A framework that yields solutions to both the visit problem and the terrain model acquisitioh problem using a single approach is presented. The approach consists of incrementally constructing, in an algorithmic manner, an appropriate geometric graph structure (1-skeleton), called the navigational course. A point robot employs the restricted visibility graph and the visibility graph as the navigational course in two- and three-dimensional cases respectively. A circular robot employs the modified visibility graph. The algorithms to solve the visit problem and the terrain model acquisition problem based on the abovementioned structures are presented and analyzed},

abstract = {The problem of programming a robot to carry out a systematic exploration of its environment using realistic sensors is considered in this paper. The robot is modelled as a single point moving in a twodimensional configuration space populaied with visually opaque and transparent obstacles. The robot is equipped with proximity sensors, a vision-based recognition system, and a method of odometry, all of which have some uncertainty associated with their measurements. By using visually distinctive configurations of features in the world as natural landmarks, a series of local maps is constructed. The geometrical relationships between mutually visible landmarks are used to build a relational map from this collection of local maps. This novel representation forms the basis for a systematic exploration algorithm. The approach has been implemented in simulation, and results are presented.},

@misc{Taylor1994,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of systematically exploring an unfamiliar environment in search of one or more recognizable targets. The proposed exploration algorithm is based on a novel representation of environments containing visual landmarks called the boundary place graph. This representation records the set of recognizable objects (landmarks) that are visible from the boundary of each configuration space obstacle. No metric information about the scene geometry is recorded nor are explicit prescriptions for moving between places stored. The exploration algorithm constructs the boundary place graph incrementally from sensor data. Once the robot has completely explored an environment, it can use the constructed representation to carry out further navigation tasks. In order to precisely characterize the set of environments in which this algorithm is expected to succeed, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the algorithm is guaranteed to discover all landmarks. This algorithm has been implemented on our mobile robot platform RJ, and results from these experiments are presented. Importantly, this research demonstrates that it is possible to design and implement provably correct exploration and navigation algorithms that do not require global positioning systems or metric representations of the environment.},

This is a key step for the navigation of any autonomous system. The method proposed is uniquely based on the spatio-temporal image derivatives, and has O(n 2 ) complexity. We search the image for particular geometric properties of the normal flow, tightly connected to the egomotion parameters, in two successive steps. The -line search algorithm determines the direction of the focus of expansion (FOE) and computes some information on the rotation parameters. Finally, the -line search algorithm determines the FOE, and the individual values of the rotation. Various experiments with synthetic and real images are presented and discussed},

abstract = {Polytechnic University is an urban Science and Engineering school with substantial enrolments of non-majority students. Recent efforts at the Polytechnic have focused on increasing enrolment of minority women enrolled in two year college physical science and pre-engineering programs to transfer into four-year engineering B.S. Programs. A new core curriculum required for all entering freshmen in engineering disciplines, and encouraged for minority transfer students, emphasizes hands-on laboratory based learning, engineering and mathematics upfront on a need to know basis, cooperative learning, and the development of oral and written communication skills. Preliminary evaluation of the core for 144 entering students in fall, 1993, demonstrated that while most students prefer the new approach, women and/or black and Hispanic students are significantly more enthusiastic about cooperative learning, hands-on learning, and peer tutoring; and less enthusiastic about traditional lecture-based teaching and learning. These students also show differences in learning style preferences as assessed by the Myers-Briggs Inventory. This paper presents longitudinal follow-up data for the above sample of 144 students entering Polytechnic in fall, 1993, and an additional 196 students entering in fall, 1994. Data includes course performance and grades in the new core and in more “traditional” engineering and science courses, course evaluations and learning style preferences as assessed by the Myers-Briggs},

@article{Sackrowitz1996,
abstract = {This study looks at students in introductory computer science courses at two major universities in order to understand some of the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in the number of female computer science majors. The study focuses on gender differences in preparation and skills and the implications of these differences on success in the introductory course.The study showed that despite the proliferation of computers in many areas of daily life, female students still enter introductory computer science classes with weaker programming skills and less involvement with computers than their male counterparts.Prior familiarity with programming concepts emerged as the most useful predictor of success in the course and a high level of success was difficult to achieve without this prior knowledge. The mean grades were comparable for men and women but the women were underrepresented among the highest achievers.This study suggests that the above factors combine to place women at a disadvantage in introductory computer science classes and that some adjustments to the pace and/or structure of this course might be necessary to attract and retain more women in the major.},

@article{Lin1997,
abstract = {Multi-agent robotic systems are useful in many practical applications. For some tasks, such as holding a conference, cooperation among agents are necessary. For other tasks, such as cleaning a room, multiple agents can work in parallel for better performance. This paper provides help-based (HCP) and coordination-based (CCP) protocols for controlling agents to accomplish multi-agent tasks. The HCP utilizes efficient negotiation to coordinate agents into groups. The CCP improves overall performance by exchanging local knowledge among agents and making decisions in parallel. A reactive and modularized agent architecture was employed to implement the protocols. Since each protocol is embedded into the architecture, it is efficient and effective. In addition, the protocols are deadlock-free. The protocols were utilized to solve the Object-Sorting Task, which abstracts two characteristics of tasks: parallelism and cooperation. The experimental results showed that 1) both HCP and CCP are stable under different workload; 2) the protocols can effectively utilize the agent-power to achieve super-linear improvement; 3) The CCP is better than the HCP in both performance and speedup.},

@article{Kalmijn1997,
abstract = {A high intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and a low intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids have been related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease has been associated with dementia. We investigated the association between fat intake and incident dementia among participants, age 55 years or older, from the population-based prospective Rotterdam Study. Food intake of 5,386 nondemented participants was assessed at baseline with a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. At baseline and after an average of 2.1 years of follow-up, we screened for dementia with a three-step protocol that included a clinical examination. The risk of dementia at follow-up (RR [95\% CI]) was assessed with logistic regression. After adjustment for age, sex, education, and energy intake, high intakes of the following nutrients were associated with an increased risk of dementia: total fat (RR = 2.4 [1.1-5.2]), saturated fat (RR = 1.9 [0.9-4.0]), and cholesterol (RR = 1.7 [0.9-3.2]). Dementia with a vascular component was most strongly related to total fat and saturated fat. Fish consumption, an important source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, was inversely related to incident dementia (RR = 0.4 [0.2-0.91), and in particular to Alzheimer's disease (RR = 0.3 [0.1-0.9]). This study suggests that a high saturated fat and cholesterol intake increases the risk of dementia, whereas fish consumption may decrease this risk.},

abstract = {There have been two thrusts in the development of optical flow algorithms. One has emphasized higher accuracy; the other faster implementation. These two thrusts, however, have been independently pursued, without addressing the accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs. Although the accuracy-efficiency characteristic is algorithm dependent, an understanding of a general pattern is crucial in evaluating an algorithm as far as real world tasks are concerned, which often pose various performance requirements. This paper addresses many implementation issues that have often been neglected in previous research, including subsampling, temporal filtering of the output stream, algorithms' flexibility and robustness, etc. Their impacts on accuracy and/or efficiency are emphasized. We present a critical survey of different approaches toward the goal of higher performance and present experimental studies on accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between the accuracy and the efficiency-oriented approaches.},

@misc{Lambrinos2000,
abstract = {The ability to navigate in a complex environment is crucial for both animals and robots. Many animals use a combination of different strategies to return to significant locations in their environment. For example, the desert ant Cataglyphis is able to explore its desert habitat for hundreds of meters while foraging and return back to its nest precisely and on a straight line. The three main strategies that Cataglyphis is using to accomplish this task are path integration, visual piloting and systematic search. In this study, we use a synthetic methodology to gain additional insights into the navigation behavior of Cataglyphis. Inspired by the insect's navigation system we have developed mechanisms for path integration and visual piloting that were successfully employed on the mobile robot Sahabot 2. One the one hand, the results obtained from these experiments provide support for the underlying biological models. On the other hand, by taking the parsimonious navigation strategies of insects as a guideline, computationally cheap navigationmethodsformobilerobots are derived from the insights gained in the experiments.},

abstract = {A map is a description which represents the structure of an environment. In order for a robot to move from a point to another eficiently in an environment, a map of the environment is the essential information. \^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\'{u}Omni- View Sequence\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\`{u} is a kind of route representation which we have developed for robot navigation in a corridor environment. It contains a sequence of omnidirectional views as the information of a route. However it cannot be regarded as a map, because the start and the goal points of the route are both fixed. In this paper, we first propose a map named (\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\`{o}View- Sequenced Map\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\`{u} which can represents a whole corridor environment on a floor in a building. Then we describe the method for acquiring a View-Sequenced Map automatically based on the exploration of a robot in a corridor using both stereo and omnidirectional vision. Finally experimental results of the map acquisition and the autonomous navigation are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed map representation.},

abstract = {Integrating robotics research with undergraduate education First, we offer courses in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Both AI and computer vision serve as prerequisites for the robotics course. Second, we involve students in ongoing research projects as part of their undergraduate experience. The article describe two undergraduate group projects we conducted, one from 1998 at the University of North Dakota advised by Maxwell, and one from 1999 at Swarthmore advised by both authors. Research goals: * improving our institution's reputation in the field of robotics, * developing working implementations of current research results, and * generating publishable results. Educational goals: * Give students hands-on experience with real problems. * Give students experience in understanding and implementing robotics principles from primary research literature. * Give students confidence in their ability. * Help students develop teamwork skills. The course outline: 1. Introduction to robots and robot motion Basic robot and sensor concepts Maps and evidence grids Configuration space Path-planning algorithms 2. Navigation using behaviors and learning Subsumption architectures Saphira architecture and fuzzy logic Artificial neural networks Reinforcement learning Evolutionary computation 3. Robot vision and sensor integration Real-time vision techniques Edges and segmentation Calibration and stereo Motion detection and tracking 4. Robot control architectures Multiple-layer designs Cognitive models and concept development 5. Human--robot interface design Kinematic analysis Speech recognition Robot personalities and emotions Educational outcomes: achieved good progress in all of the students' educational outcomes both from a pedagogical point of view and based on their own evaluations. The students had a hands-on experience with a real problem and a hard deadline. Most of the students read one or more papers from the robotics and computer vision literature and implemented at least a portion of an algorithm or concept from one or more of the papers. The need to collaborate fostered students' teamwork skills, while project completion and competition success greatly enhanced the students' self-confidence. Experience with moving from the simulator to the robot highlighted the following issues: * The simulator coordinate systems or function calls did not always behave identically to the actual robot. This required students to make small changes---for example, query and replace---to the code before it would work correctly. * The simulator constants such as velocity and acceleration required adjustments for safety reasons when students began working with the actual robots. The students tended to ``crank up'' these values in the simulation. * The actual sensor values tended to be noisier, and possess biases, compared to those in the simulator. The lab descriptions are linked to the course home page at www.palantir.swarthmore.edu/\~{}maxwell/classes/e28. The goal of our first lab was to introduce students, with the Nomad simulator, to robot programming's basic concepts. The second lab provided students with experience in standard path-planning techniques via the Nomad simulator and the actual Scout II robots. In the third lab, students explored robot learning with the Khepera simulator and the Khepera robots. In the fourth lab, students designed a robot vision system for a particular task.},

abstract = {A multiple view system uses two or more distinct views to support the investigation of a single conceptual entity. Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.},

abstract = {Ant robots are simple creatures with limited sensing and computational capabilities. They have the advantage that they are easy to program and cheap to build. This makes it feasible to deploy groups of ant robots and take advantage of the resulting fault tolerance and paral- lelism. We study, both theoretically and in simulation, the behavior of ant robots for one-time or repeated coverage of terrain, as required for lawn mowing, mine sweeping, and surveil- lance. Ant robots cannot use conventional planning methods due to their limited sensing and computational capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we study navigation methods that are based on real-time (heuristic) search and leave markings in the terrain, similar to what real ants do. These markings can be sensed by all ant robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The ant robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. We study two simple real-time search methods that differ only in how the markings are updated. We show experimentally that both real-time search methods robustly cover terrain even if the ant robots are moved without re- alizing this (say, by people running into them), some ant robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. Both real-time search methods are algorithmically similar, and our experimental results indicate that their cover time is similar in some terrains. Our analysis is therefore sur- prising. We show that the cover time of ant robots that use one of the real-time search methods is guaranteed to be polynomial in the number of locations, whereas the cover time of ant ro- bots that use the other real-time search method can be exponential in (the square root of) the number of locations even in simple terrains that correspond to (planar) undirected trees.},

abstract = {Teaching design and project management with lego RCX robots The course unit described here took time out from a Java-based CS 1 course to give students practical experience in programming a small robot in a highly restricted setting. The unit "Robot Planning and Design" had three goals: 1 . Provide a highly restricted environment in which mindless re-testing could not take place, 2. Break away from preconceived notions about what the fundamental tools were, 3. Make the experience sufficiently rewarding in and of itself, so that negative outcomes (failed attempts) provided significant lessons. 2 robots, 20 students, limit use Our goals, explicitly stated in the lab assignment were to: * teach students first hand what it means to plan out a project, * give students experience working with "real world" devices, * give students insight into the nature of programming languages. The Lego RCX Assignment: Week 1: Learning the Basics: During the first week, the students were introduced to the RCX language, the tutorials and the environment on personal computers that supports it. Week 2: Implementing a Problem Solution: team work together and write RCX code to navigate the robot from a start position in one room, to an end position in the other. Your robot just has to get there, but it is even better if it can detect that it has reached the end position. Week 3: One Shot Testing: the robots were made available to the students. The groups were encouraged to preplan their two-hour experience, and especially to have a navigation program ready for downloading before the session. They were allowed to modify their program after the session, but could not retest. Week 4: Solutions were demonstrated in a lab session at the beginning of week four. The discussion kept returning to two topics: (1) the failure of the robotic devices to behave predictably, and (2) the need to program reactively (based on events) rather than sequentially. Students identified three sources for learning RCX code: the on-line, multi-media tutorial, their classmates, and simple experimentation. Students also expressed in some form insight into the distinction between sequential and reactive programming: the early experimentation with robot parts had taught them that rigid deterministic solutions would not work. The results of the robot trials are summarized as follows: * One robot managed to make it three rooms away by properly detecting doors. It finally failed when it couldn't turn adequately to find a door. It kept just missing the door, first on the left, then on the right. This, the most successful robot was the result of significant attention to design using systematic methods promoted in class. It is possible, that given unlimited time (e.g. more than 10 minutes) it might have found its way to the goal. * One robot correctly adjusted to corners, turning in small increments, by backing up a bit, and moving forward until it found the wall again. Unfortunately, it could not detect an open door unless it simply stumbled through it. This group suffered from the problem of over-engineering one component. Although their robot was best at turning, the light sensing procedure (needed to walk through doors) had never been adequately tested in conjunction with the other procedures for turning and moving forward. * One robot climbed the walls due to the speed with which the motors were set. The team had not anticipated that the touch sensor event used to detect an encounter with a wall would be thwarted because of the speed of the robot. In their two-hour testing period they did not have time to try bumping into things to see what would happen. * One robot, when it encountered a corner turned into the corner rather than out of it. We later realized that this group had tested its software with the motors reversed. Their solution, jerry-rigged during the testing period, failed completely because the robots were rebuilt (after both were accidentally disassembled) before the demonstration. * The most beloved robot (and the first to be emonstrated) backed up against the wall by the tarting position, moved into the exact center of the room and proceeded to spin madly in a circle. Its turning procedure was in an infinite loop, and so it wouldn't stop trying to turn. We rescued it when it spit one of its wheels into space. This group's members admitted that their testing time was wasted because they had not mastered the basics before hand. Experience Worthwhile: * an appreciation for thinking through a problem * a much needed break from Java * an appreciation a programming language is * insight into robotics * a chance to" fail miserably" and still get credit},

@article{Burstedde2001a,
abstract = {We propose a 2-dimensional cellular automaton model to simulate pedestrian traffic. It is a vmax=1 model with exclusion statistics and parallel dynamics. Long-range interactions between the pedestrians are mediated by a so called floor field which modifies the transition rates to neighbouring cells. This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace. Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke.},

@article{Latimer2002,
abstract = {We introduce an algorithm to cover an unknown space with a homogeneous team of circular mobile robots. Our approach is based on a single robot coverage algorithm, a boustrophedon approach, which divides the target two-dimensional space into regions called cells, each of which can be covered with simple back and forth motions. Single robot coverage is then achieved by ensuring that the robot visits each cell. The new multi-robot coverage algorithm uses the same planar cell-based approach as the single robot approach, but also prescribes the methods by which multiple robots cover a cell, teams are allocated among cells, and sub-teams of robots share information in a minimalistic manner. The advantage of this method is that planning occurs in a two dimensional configuration space for a team of n robots, bypassing the need to plan in a 2n dimensional configuration space. The approach is semi-decentralized: robot teams cover the space independent of each other, but robots within a team communicate state and share informatio},

@article{Bourgault2002,
abstract = {Exploration involving mapping and concurrent localization in an unknown environment is a pervasive task in mobile robotics. In general, the accuracy of the mapping process depends directly on the accuracy of the localization process. This paper address the problem of maximizing the accuracy of the map building process during exploration by adaptively selecting control actions that maximize localisation accuracy. The map building and exploration task is modeled using an Occupancy Grid (OG) with concurrent localisation performed using a feature-based Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Adaptive sensing aims at maximizing the map information by simultaneously maximizing the expected Shannon information gain (Mutual Information) on the OG map and minimizing the uncertainty of the vehicle pose and map feature uncertainty in the SLAM process. The resulting map building system is demonstrated in an indoor environment using data from a laser scanner mounted on a mobile platform.},

abstract = {The problem of coverage without a priori global information about the environment is a key element of the general exploration problem. Applications vary from exploration of the Mars surface to the urban search and rescue (USAR) domain, where neither a map, nor a Global Positioning System (GPS) are available. We propose two algorithms for solving the 2D coverage problem using multiple mobile robots. The basic premise of both algorithms is that local dispersion is a natural way to achieve global coverage. Thus, both algorithms are based on local, mutually dispersive interaction between robots when they are within sensing range of each other. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms solve the problem to within 5-7\% of the (manually generated) optimal solutions. We show that the nature of the interaction needed between robots is very simple; indeed anonymous interaction slightly outperforms a more complicated local technique based on ephemeral identification.},

We introduce the idea of component-based development by defining the concept and providing its economic rationale. We describe how object-oriented programming evolved into local component models, such as Java Beans and distributed object technologies, such as the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and the Component Object Model (COM). We then address how these technologies matured into distributed component models, in particular Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and the CORBA Component Model (CCM). We give an assessment of the maturity of each of these technologies and sketch how they are used to build distributed architectures.},

abstract = {Well adapted to the loosely coupled nature of distributed interaction in large-scale applications, the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has recently received increasing attention. With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.},

@article{Dai2003,
abstract = {Robot localization is one of the most fundamental problems in robotic research, especially in multi-robots system. At present, most multi MICRO robots systems only utilize external vision camera to provide location information and adopt method based on chromatic image segmentation techniques to localize each robot. This method has high requirement on system hardware while is less robust to run in practical simulation. This paper introduces a localization method of multi micro-robots based on Markov algorithm, which not only uses image captured by external camera but also motion model of each robot to perform localization task. It requires less system resources while gives more robust results. This approach is also scalable and efficient to deal with a system that has a larger number of micro robots.},

abstract = {The World Trade Center (WTC) rescue response provided an unfortunate opportunity to study the human-robot interactions (HRI) during a real unstaged rescue for the first time. A post-hoc analysis was performed on the data collected during the response, which resulted in 17 findings on the impact of the environment and conditions on the HRI: the skills displayed and needed by robots and humans, the details of the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, the social informatics in the USAR domain, and what information is communicated at what time. The results of this work impact the field of robotics by providing a case study for HRI in USAR drawn from an unstaged USAR effort. Eleven recommendations are made based on the findings that impact the robotics, computer science, engineering, psychology, and rescue fields. These recommendations call for group organization and user confidence studies, more research into perceptual and assistive interfaces, and formal models of the state of the robot, state of the world, and information as to what has been observed.},

abstract = {We report the results of a year-long experiment in the use of robots to teach computer science. Our data set compares results from over 800 students on identical tests from both robotics and non-robotics based laboratory sessions. We also examine the effectiveness of robots in encouraging students to select computer science or computer engineering as a field of study.Our results are negative: test scores were lower in the robotics sections than in the non-robotics ones, nor did the use of robots have any measurable effect on students choice of discipline. We believe the most significant factor that accounts for this is the lack of a simulator for our robotics programming system. Students in robotics sections must run and debug their programs on robots during assigned lab times, and are therefore deprived of both reflective time and the rapid compile-run-debug cycle outside of class that is an important part of the learning process. We discuss this and other issues, and suggest directions for future work.},

abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for feature- based exploration of a priori nnknaun environments. We aim to build a robot that, unsupervised, plans its motion such that it continually increases both the spatial extent and detail of its world model - its map. We present a method by which the planned motion at any instant is motivated by the geometric, spatial and stochastic characteristics of the current map. In particular each feature within the map is responsible for determining nearby unexplored areas that if visited are likely to constitute exploration. We assume that the location of the featum is uncertain and represented by a set of probability distribution functions (pdfs). These distributions are used in conjunction with the robot path history to determine a robot trajectory suited to exploration. We show results that demonstrate the algorithm providing real-time exploration of a mobile robot in an unknown environment.navigation.},

Each robot can then moue away from the other nearby robots, resulting in the mbot collective swiftly dispersing through the local area. The technique has been implemented using the miniature Scout robots, developed by the Center for Distributed Robotics at the University of Minnesota, which are well-suited to surueil- lance and reconnaissance missions.},

abstract = {Robot in the classroom This article: Present an integrated approach for incorporating robotics into secondary education with the objective of further engaging students through an exciting application of math, computers, and science. Resource: an adaptable mobile robot kit with detailed do-it-yourself online instructions, various Web-based course offerings with material directed to both secondary students and teachers, and a personnel support structure, including college engineering faculty, secondary teachers, practicing engineers, undergraduate engineering students, and junior-high and high-school students. Four-part education plan (Figure 2) focused on assembling the following key components: * experimental hardware for hands-on investigations * sample secondary education curriculum * continued education for teachers * complete Web-based documentation and resources. The kit is based on a two-tier design, primarily to provide electrical noise isolation for the low-power components from the high-power electronics and to offer an easily accessible enclosure for the sensors and other sensitive electronics. The ample 2-Ah lead-acid battery is accompanied by a wall charger, thereby providing a safe mechanisim for in situ recharging of the battery. Both the proximity sensors and the dual H-bridge require no additional interfacing circuitry, thereby resulting in a simplified overall design. 1) The NMT mobile robot kit: http://www.ee.nmt.edu/\~{}mrobokit/ Description: The main page for the NMT robot kit hardware/software and assembly manual. 2) Exploration in Robotics: http://www.ee.nmt.edu/\~{}wedeward/AA/main.html Description: A six-week summer course directed at middle- to high-school students.

Our system has been deployed in three abandoned mines, two of which inaccessible to people, where it has acquired maps of unprecedented detail and accuracy.},

abstract = {A team of small low cost robots instead of one big, complex robot is useful in operations such as search and rescue, urban exploration etc. However, the performance of such a team is limited due to restricted mobility of the team members. We propose to overcome the mobility restrictions by physical cooperation among the team members. We carry out a feasibility analysis of a particular behavior of two robots cooperating to cross a gap. We simulate the dynamic equations describing the motion, which leads to the relaxation of the requirements derived from the static analysis. A decentralized control architecture is designed which avoids continuous communication between the robots thus rendering the cooperation to be simple and low cost.},

abstract = {Popular interest in robotics has increased astonishingly in the last few years. Robotics is seen by many as offering major new benefits in education at all levels. Before rushing to exploit this popularity, educators should ask serious questions about the universality and longevity of the robotics phenomenon. Is it a fashion? To be useful, the energy released by robotics must be sustained and universal, and the means of exploiting it must be systematic. Universities define their own robotics curriculum, but most schools lack both the resources and the freedom to do this, and must work with a national curriculum. If it can be shown that robotics has sustained potential in education, it seems inevitable that new ways need to be found to integrate it into the school curriculum.

abstract = {We consider the problem of coverage and exploration of an unknown dynamic environment using a mobile robot. The environment is assumed to be large enough such that constant motion by the robot is needed to cover the environment. We present an efficient minimalist algorithm which assumes that global information is not available (neither a map, nor GPS). Our algorithm deploys a network of radio beacons which assists the robot in coverage. The network is also used by the robot for navigation. The deployed network can also be used for applications other than coverage (such as multi-robot task allocation). Simulation experiments are presented which show the collaboration between the deployed network and mobile robot for the tasks of coverage/exploration, network deployment and maintenance (repair), and mobile robot recovery (homing behavior). We discuss a theoretical basis for our algorithm on graphs and show the results of the simulated scenario experiments.},

abstract = {Acquiring models of the environment belongs to the fundamental tasks of mobile robots. In the last few years several researchers have focused on the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Classic SLAM approaches are passive in the sense that they only process the perceived sensor data and do not influence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper we present a novel and integrated approach that combines autonomous exploration with simultaneous localization and mapping. Our method uses a grid-based version of the FastSLAM algorithm and at each point in time considers actions to actively close loops during exploration. By re-entering already visited areas the robot reduces its localization error and this way learns more accurate maps. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches lacking the ability to actively close loops.},

abstract = {Efficient use of robots in the undergraduate curriculum The article: Describe how a single Khepera II robot was used for an assignment in a senior level course on graphical user interface implementation. It required each student to implement a graphical user interface for remotely controlling a Khepera II robot. The focus of the project was how to efficiently and effectively allow the 35 students enrolled in the course to have access to the robot for the purposes of testing and debugging. The intent was to see if an assignment making use of the robot would stimulate student interest, and whether it could be done with a minimal investment in hardware, lab, and instructor resources. In this course the students learn to implement graphical user interfaces using the Java Swing API. The result of the student's work will be a client program that can connect to a robot server, can query the state of the Khepera II, and can send motion commands to the Khepera II. The assignment has the following goals in terms of the GUI implementation: * Implement a fairly complex GUI with several different panels and files. * Customize a JPanel by extending and then overriding paintComponent( ). * Use Action objects to create both buttons and menu items. * Use TitledBorders to group and organize components. * The continuing exposure of the student to design patterns Several problems needed to be considered in order to make this assignment feasible: * How to minimize the effort needed to communicate with the Khepera II so that the student could focus on the GUI implementation. * How to provide a connection to the Khepera II to students as they design, implement, test, and debug, their GUI. * How to ensure fairness among the students in terms of connect time to the robot. * How to ensure that only one student GUI is controlling the Khepera II at any given time. * How to ensure the safety of the Khepera II. * How to allow the student to see what the Khepera II is actually doing. The Robot class provides the following functionality in its public interface: * A method is provided for each type of low-level command that can be sent to the robot. This is similar to the approach taken by Harlan, et al [6]. * Several methods are provided that implement high-level commands. These can be used by the student to make the robot perform certain actions (turn right 90 degrees, for example) without having to worry about calculating the parameters needed for the low-level commands to accomplish this. * An entire set of synchronized methods to access the state of the robot (as maintained in the Robot object). This includes such things as the current proximity readings, wheel motor position and speed, and so on. * The Robot class also provides a method that will parse a command from the robot and update the instance variables accordingly. The server provides the following services: * In the running mode that was selected, the Khepera II does not have any way to generate events to the host computer. Therefore, it must be polled. The server polls the robot several times per second and updates the state maintained in the Robot object (the server uses the same class as the client for this purpose). * The server will accept multiple client connections. * Only one of the clients is allowed to send commands to the robot at any given time. Messages coming in from a client are passed to the Khepera II robot, assuming that client is currently selected to be controlling the actions of the robot. These messages are passed directly through the server to the robot. * One of the first problems encountered was the need for a timeout on client connections. * Another problem was encountered in which some students' client applications would put the Khepera II into a state where it was spinning madly, or running continuously even though it was up against a wall. * The server logs the date, time, and IP address for each client connected or when a connection is closed. One advantage to utilizing a resource such as the Khepera II in a classroom situation is that it makes the students aware of the availability of the lab and the research equipment in it.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to enable users to semiautomatically segment the anatomical structures in magnetic resonance images (MRIs), computerized tomographs (CTs), and other medical images on a personal computer. The segmented images are used for making 3D images, which are helpful to medical education and research. To achieve this purpose, the following trials were performed. The entire body of a volunteer was scanned to make 557 MRIs. On Adobe Photoshop, contours of 19 anatomical structures in the MRIs were semiautomatically drawn using MAGNETIC LASSO TOOL and manually corrected using either LASSO TOOL or DIRECT SELECTION TOOL to make 557 segmented images. In a similar manner, 13 anatomical structures in 8,590 anatomical images were segmented. Proper segmentation was verified by making 3D images from the segmented images. Semiautomatic segmentation using Adobe Photoshop is expected to be widely used for segmentation of anatomical structures in various medical images.},

abstract = {Multidisciplinary teamwork in a robotics course Course: Robotics: Integrated System Design. A senior-level elective in the three majors: CS, ECE, and ME The goal of this project is the development of a comprehensive undergraduate course in robotics that encompasses various fields that are integral to robotic systems: Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. A main pedagogical goal of the course: * To gain hands-on experience in practical robotics * To learn about integrated system design * To learn to interact with people in different disciplines in a cross-functional team * To learn about group dynamics and teamwork Each team was assigned at least one student from CS, ME, and ECE How teams work and how team members may interact within their group: * What defines a team? * Team process: team roles, decision making, conflict resolution * How to run an effective team meeting * Characteristics of good and bad team members * The difference between constructive and destructive criticism * Individual personality types and their impact on how individuals work and interact * Brainstorming methods Provide a hands-on, multidisciplinary design experience that complements the lecture material: Assignment 1: Rube Goldberg Machine The first assignment involved the design and implementation of a Rube Goldberg Machine (www.rgmc.com) that would capture a mouse without harming it. Assignment 2: Mobile Bug Behavior The second assignment was designed to help students learn about the electronics components of their kits and give them experience with the programming environment. Assignment 3: Homing Light Sensor The third assignment required the design and fabrication of a custom light sensor that could "home in" on a light source. Assignment 4: Robotic Arm The fourth assignment involved the design of a two-link manipulator robotic arm that would accurately track a one-inch-radius circular closed path with its tip. Project: Autonomous Search \& Rescue The objective of the culminating project was to design and implement an autonomous urban search and rescue robot for an earthquake-damaged building, as detailed in Figure 1.

@article{Duke2006,
abstract = {Course: Introduction to Mobile Robot Programming (for second-semester freshmen) Requirements: one semester of programming as a prerequisite, and another as a corequisite The robotic platform used is the AmigoBot from ActivMedia. A standard Linux-based laptop. Software: Java and the Eclipse IDE. Curriculum: First half semester: nonlinear. Robot characterization, reactive control, open- and closed-loop control, precision movement, and learning via operant conditioning Second half semester: progressive. Begin by having the students build primitives to map precision movement into movement commands useful for sensing and navigating a maze and bounding error accumulation. The next step is sequential planning, in which the robot must generate and execute its own plan for solving an arbitrary maze given a known starting point, goal and maze. Finally, information is hidden, and mazes must be solved both in the case where the starting position of the robot is unknown as well as in the case where the maze is not known. Logistics: one instructor, 2 TAs. 26 students, 13 teams, 2 of each. Each team uses one laptop and share time on 8 robots. Weekly cycle work. Observations: * Robotics is a fertile field for generating interesting computational problems which are interesting but do not require extensive computer science backgrounds to approach. * Competition is good. * Keeping teams fluid for much of the semester improved the students' teamwork skills by letting them work with a variety of personalities and coding styles. * Making the code repository available is a valuable method for teaching the students how to read, understand, and debug code, and to find examples of design patterns which work well. It also helps to keep students from falling irreparably behind as lab assignments begin to build on previous work. * When debugging, students are forced to come up with strategies for making behavior triggers visible and breaking down the problem into smaller parts. * To be effective, teaching this course requires a significant amount of time invested in interactions between instructors and small groups},

abstract = {The last decade marked the first real attempt to turn software development into engineering through the concepts of Component-Based Software Development (CBSD) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, with the goal of creating high-quality parts that could be joined together to form a functioning system. One of the most critical processes in CBSD is the selection of a set of software components from in-house or external repositories that fulfil some architectural and user-defined requirements. However, there is a lack of quality models and metrics that can help evaluate the quality characteristics of software components during this selection process. This paper presents a set of measures to assess the Usability of software components, and describes the method followed to obtain and validate them. Such a method can be re-used as a pattern for defining and validating measures for further quality characteristics.},

These experiments successfully demonstrate the practicality of cyclic pursuit as a distributed control strategy for multiple wheeled-robot systems. The pursuit-based coordination algorithm was found to be surprisingly robust in the presence of unmodelled dynamics and delays due to sensing and information processing. Moreover, the findings of this research not only bode well for continuing research on pursuit-based coordination strategies, but also for other cooperative multirobot control techniques employing similar local interactions.},

abstract = {Mobile robot programming in education The Mobile Robot Programming Laboratory course is a problem-driven class designed for students with little or no experience with robots. * First it emphasizes robot programming whereas many other classes also cover robot morphology and construction. It focuses solely on robot programming and therefore uses a preassembled, commercially-available platform. Thus the students can begin programming the robot immediately and hardware-related concerns are kept to a minimum. * The second major difference concerns hands-on experience. It strives to provide a large amount of hands on experience under real-world constraints by providing each team with a robot to which they have virtually unlimited access. Logistics: one-semester, problem-driven syllabus, 30 students, 2 TAs, team of three. Platform: The current robotic platform in use is the Nomad Scout differential-drive robot mounted by a Dell laptop computer running the Java 1.4.2 runtime environment under Windows XP (see Figure 1). Curriculum: Fundamental concepts: * Perception: the robots are equipped with two different kinds of sensors: 16 sonars and one camera. * Action: The main action-related challenge is to build a robot that can move in a maze very accurately. * Cognition: Because the robots are constrained to evolve in a structured, discrete environment, the low-level navigation is sufficiently facilitated and the course can graduate to AIlevel programming assignments after the first third of the semester. Advanced concepts: * Robot observability: An important aspect of mobile robot programming learned by the students in this class is the psychology of diagnosing a misbehaving robot. * Property mapping: Throughout the semester, students learned how to map a set of robot percepts to outputs. * Reinforcement learning: Although not in the original curriculum, that same team also explored reinforcement learning by implementing a simple version of the well-known Q-learning algorithm. * Multi-robot coordination: During the last part of the class, the teams are asked to build a two-robot team that competes against another team in the same maze. EVOLUTION: * Hardware environment: The hardware on which the students work has a great influence on their learning experience. * Programming environment: also has a critical importance on the class. * Final challenge: The final challenge given to the students depended primarily on the available hardware. Initially, robots were competing one-on-one in a shared maze, and the goal was to reach a particular position in the maze first. * Teamwork: Learning how to work efficiently in teams is crucial in many endeavors, and the Mobile Robot Programming Laboratory class provides a great teamwork opportunity to students.},

abstract = {Components, curriculum, and community-robots and robotics in undergraduate AI education.(artificial intelligence) The Article: * Overviews a number of robot platforms and presents trade-offs in choosing among them. * Highlight the variety of AI curricula supported by low-cost robotic platforms. * Conclude with a summary of the engaging and active communities that support robotic competitions and exhibitions. 1. Platforms: A key advantage of the two most popular platforms, Lego Mindstorms (or RCX brick) and the Handy Board: the variety of ways in which students can program them. Other Kits: * Palm Pilot robot kit (Reshko, Mason, and Nourbakhsh 2002; Avanzato 2004) * Nintendo Game Boy Advance's Xport Robot Controller (XRC) and related XBC (LeGrand et al. 2005). * Pontech's SV 203 (Bishop et al. 2004). They are less well established. One perceived disadvantage of robot kits: the resulting platforms can provide software support for only a low level of behavioral abstraction. How to mitigate: topics as computationally demanding and subtle as A * search and Markov decision processes have run entirely on a Handy Board. Further, because it is easy to download information from each of these platforms to a PC, all of these systems can be used to collect data for off-board analysis In practice, a more important disadvantage of all of these platforms' flexibility: they are more difficult to support with simulation software, as neither the robot morphology nor its sensor suite is known a priori. In contrast to robot kits, preassembled platforms offer additional capabilities and convenience at a higher cost: K-Team's miniature robot, the Khepera; K-Team's newer and slightly larger robot, the Hemission Sony's robotic quadruped, the AIBO: existing resources may be easier to integrate 2. Simulations: Simulation is an attractive option for AI educators for many reasons: * the speed of students' design-test-debug cycles, * the repeatability of experiments, * the availability of rich visualization tools that may not be available on board a physical platform * the (simulated) access to expensive or unavailable platforms or sensors Two powerful, general-purpose simulators are the open-source projects Stage and Gazebo. One drawback to using simulation is the loss of the physical embodiment that attracts many students to learning AI with robots. Another potential problem is the loss of the unpredictability of real-world physical interaction. The ideal educational toolset comprises both a simulator and robot hardware with identical programming APIs. Simulators can expand the reach of a few (or no) hardware resources to a much larger class of students. 3. Sensing and Computation The sensor suite available is likely to have the greatest curricular--and financial--impact on an undergraduate's experience with AI robotics. Shaft encoders, which allow the measurement of position and velocity, and a ring of range sensors (sonar in the case of the Pioneers, IR for the Khepera and Hemisson) offer student access to spatial reasoning algorithms from basic wall following to topological mapping. 4. Onward The available resources for incorporating robots into AI education are considerable, yet they may only hint at the opportunities on the horizon. One emerging possibility is that some educational robots will blur away from the status quo of "complete systems" into peripheral form factors that use existing cameras, laptop computers, and networking capabilities. The impact, marketing power, and economies of scale in the toy and entertainment industry will continue to play important roles in creating inexpensive robotics resources. The software that supports AI robotics education will continue to mature: 1. Commercial third-party products such as the multiplatform Webots simulator and the RoboJDE development environment (Michel 2004) offer turnkey interfacing and development capabilities. 2. The research community: the Stage and Gazebo simulators demonstrate the benefits of developing a research-inspired codebase into a more general-purpose tool. 3. Enthusiasts of all stripes donate time and effort to make the materials they have developed available to the community. 5. AI Robotics Curricula Robot platforms can be introduced into AI education in a variety of ways, ranging from adding a single robot assignment to an AI course to designing a complete AI robotics course to adding AI material to an integrated robot engineering course. Robot kits such as the Lego RCX, Handy Board, or Xport use Lego building blocks and gears to provide an easy means for students to build mechanical structures. The use of such platforms must be weighed against the time students spend building and rebuilding. Alternatives approaches provide prebuilt platforms (for example, Bruder and Wedeward [2003]) or plans for and examples of platforms to aid student construction. 6. Robot Contests: Robocup, AAAI 7. Local Competitions: A part of many robotics courses, local competitions are the culmination of a sequence of laboratory exercises for building and programming a robot, which provide students with a goal to strive toward. 8.

Figure 1 A Comparison o f the Price, Form Factor, Sensing, and Computational Capabilities of Eight Low-Cost Robotic Platforms Used in AI Robotics Settings. Lego Mindstorms Popular because it works out-of-the-box, \$199 10x3x6 cm (w/o chassis) the yellow lego RCX brick has inspired www.legomindstorms.com curricula and freely available software, such as is described in Klassner (2004), and Parsons and Sklar (2004). Sonar, rotation, and IR sensors can extend provided touch/light inputs. Xport Robot Controller The Xport leverages the computation of a \$269 8x3x1cm (w/o chassis) hand-held GameBoy (not included). KIPR www.charmedlabs.com offers a very capable vision-augmented system, the XBC (Le-Grand et al. 2005), that provides easily configurable and very powerful region tracking. Handy Board Controller Although the price does not include \$299 12x8x3 cm (w/o chassis) sensors or a typically Lego chassis, handyboard.com the Handy Board supports touch, light, sonar, IR, compass, and vision sensing. It is used in many AI courses (Imberman 2004, Danyluk 2004, Martin and Pantazopoulos 2004). Palm Pilot Robot Kit The Palm Pilot stand-alone kit relies on \$315 18 cm dia. x 6 cm Acronames B rainStem controller, three www-2.cs.cmu.edu/\~{}pprk IR ranging sensors, and a handheld computer. Designed at Carnegie Mellon University (Reshko, Mason, and Nourbakhsh 2002) the PPRK has been employed for outreach beyond AI robotics (Avanzato 2004). Robix/Pontech The Robix enables many manipulator forms Manipulator via six servos and connective hardware. \$550 varying dimensions The Pontech SV203 (\$60), an 8-motor www.robix.com serial controller, can also control these servos (Crabbe 2004, Bishop et al. 2004, Sutherland 2000). Sony AIBO Used in the RoboCup legged league, the \$1900 10x3x6 cm AIBO offers a microphone, vision, and (w/o chassis) touch sensing with 802.1lb wireless for www.sony.net/Products/aibo communications. A number of freely available software interfaces exist, as well as tested AI robotics curricula (Veloso et al. 2004). ActivMedia Robots The Amigobot at right is the least \$2000+ 1Ox3x6 cm expensive of a large line of prebuilt www.activmedia.com robots from ActivMedia. With an RF link, sonar ring, odometry, and an interface to the ActivMedia Aria simulator, this robot spans research and educational uses (Konolige et al. 2004, Arkin 2000). K-Team Robots The Khepera (\$2025+), the 5-cm \$296-2025+ 5-12cm dia. x 5cm platform at left, has been used www.k-team.com in several AI robotics courses (see, for example, Harlan [2005]). It accepts a 40 huge array of sensors a},

The iconic pixmap representation is operated on by an extensible set of “visual routines” (Ullman, 1984; Forbus et al., 2001). A symbolic representation, in terms of lines, ellipses, blobs, etc., is extracted from the iconic encoding, manipulated algebraically, and re-rendered iconically. The two representations are therefore duals, and iconic operations can be freely intermixed with symbolic ones. The dual-coding approach offers robot programmers a versatile collection of primitives from which to construct application-specific vision software. We describe some sample applications implemented on the Sony AIBO.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology holds great promise for various civilian and military applications. Cooperative control of a network of autonomous UAVs poses novel challenges because of the inherent constraints like non-holonomic motion, limited range communication, etc. In this dissertation, we present some recently-developed tools and strategies for motion coordination of UAVs. In particular, the focus is on algorithms for various coordination tasks such as vehicle routing to meet service demands, deployment over a region for surveillance and flying in flock-like formations. We study minimum-time motion planning and routing problems for the Dubins vehicle, i.e., a nonholonomic vehicle that is constrained to move along planar paths of bounded curvature, without reversing direction. We consider the Traveling Salesperson Problem for the Dubins vehicle (DTSP): given n points on a plane, what is the shortest Dubins tour through these points and what is its length? We start by showing that the worst-case length of such a tour grows linearly with n and we propose a novel algorithm with worst-case performance within a constant factor approximation of the optimum. In doing this, we also obtain an upper bound on the optimal length in the classical point-to-point problem. We then study a stochastic version of the DTSP where the n targets are vi randomly sampled from a uniform distribution. We show that the expected length of such a tour is of order at least n2/3 and we propose a novel algorithm yielding a solution with length of order n2/3 with high probability. We apply these results in a dynamic version of the DTSP: given a stochastic process that generates target points, is there a policy which guarantees that the number of unvisited points does not diverge over time? If such stable policies exist, what is the minimum expected time that a newly generated target waits before being visited by the vehicle? We propose a novel stabilizing algorithms such that the expected wait time is provably within a constant factor from the optimum. We obtain analogous results for R3 and extend various results to a double integrator vehicle model. We also study a facility location problem for groups of Dubins vehicles, i.e., nonholonomic vehicles that are constrained to move along planar paths of bounded curvature, without reversing direction. Given a compact region and a group of Dubins vehicles, the coverage problem is to minimize the worst-case traveling time from any vehicle to any point in the region. Since the vehicles cannot hover, we assume that they fly along static closed curves called loitering curves. We present circular loitering patterns for a Dubins vehicle and for a group of Dubins vehicles that minimize the worst-case traveling time in sufficiently large regions. We do this by establishing an analogy to the disk covering problem. Finally, we consider ad-hoc networks of robotic agents with double integrator dynamics. For such networks, the connectivity maintenance problems are: (i) do there exist control inputs for each agent to maintain network connectivity, and (ii) given desired controls for each agent, can one compute the closest connectivitymaintaining controls in a distributed fashion? The proposed solution is based on vii three contributions. First, we define and characterize admissible sets for double integrators to remain inside disks. Second, we establish an existence theorem for the connectivity maintenance problem by introducing a novel state-dependent graph, called the double-integrator disk graph. Finally, we design a distributed “flow-control” algorithm to compute optimal connectivity-maintaining controls.},

In this paper, we provide student testimonials on the importance and benefits of practical and socially-relevant assignments. We then examined approximately 200 first year (CS1) and software engineering assignments at top computer science institutions. Only 34\% of the CS1 projects had a practical or socially-relevant context, 41\% had no context at all, and 15\% were games. For software engineering projects, 62\% were practical or socially-relevant, but still 16\% had no practical context. We recommend that educators, through their assignments, place increased emphasis on demonstrating that computer science can be used to aid society and/or produce products of practical value to society.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Robotic Development Environments (RDEs) have come to play an increasingly important role in robotics research in general, and for the development of architectures for mobile robots in particular. Yet, no systematic evaluation of available RDEs has been performed; establishing a comprehensive list of evaluation criteria targeted at robotics applications is desirable that can subsequently be used to compare their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, there are no practical evaluations of the usability and impact of a large selection of RDEs that provides researchers with the information necessary to select an RDE most suited to their needs, nor identifies trends in RDE research that suggest directions for future RDE development. This survey addresses the above by selecting and describing nine open source, freely available RDEs for mobile robots, evaluating and comparing them from various points of view. First, based on previous work concerning agent systems, a conceptual framework of four broad categories is established, encompassing the characteristics and capabilities that an RDE supports. Then, a practical evaluation of RDE\&nbsp; usability in designing, implementing, and executing robot architectures is presented. Finally, the impact of specific RDEs on the field of robotics is addressed by providing a list of published applications and research projects that give concrete examples of areas in which systems have been used. The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the nine RDEs concludes with suggestions of how to use the results of this survey and a brief discussion of future trends in RDE design.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of building effi cient coverage paths for a team of robots. An effi cient multi-robot coverage algorithm should result in a coverage path for every robot, such that the union of all paths generates a full cov- erage of the terrain and the total coverage time is minimized. A method underlying several coverage algorithms, suggests the use of spanning trees as base for creating coverage paths. However, overall performance of the coverage is heavily dependent on the given spanning tree. This paper focuses on the challenge of constructing a coverage spanning tree for both online and offl ine coverage that minimizes the time to complete coverage. Our general approach involves building a spanning tree by growing sub-trees from the initial location of the robots. This paper first describes a polynomial time tree-construction algorithm for offl ine coverage. The use of this algorithm is shown by extensive simulations to significantly improve the coverage time of the terrain even when used as a basis for a simple, ineffi cient, coverage algorithm. Second, this paper provides an algorithm for online coverage of a finite terrain based on spanning-trees, that is complete and guarantees linear time coverage with no redundancy in the coverage. In addition, the solutions proposed by this paper guarantee robustness to failing robots: the offl ine trees are used as base for robust multi-robot coverage algorithms, and the online algorithm is proven to be robust.},

abstract = {As advanced mobile technology becomes more widespread, the impacts on professional environments and on the personal lives of individual users continue to increase. Devices, such as smart cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and laptop computers can free their owners of the need to remain close to a wired information system infrastructure that is provided in a stationary office environment, and provide the opportunity to perform tasks in a wide variety of use contexts. With changes in use context, however, come changes in requirements, such as the need to limit weight and size of a device. In order to achieve success in the form of adoption, use, and positive impacts on user performance, a thorough understanding is needed about the functional and non-functional technology requirements of mobile professionals. In this paper, we summarize the results of a series of research studies that we conducted to explore the technology requirements of mobile professionals. The research studies included a content analysis of online user reviews, two empirical surveys, and a series of user interviews. Our research findings indicate that (1) user-perceived technology maturity is a critical factor to explain and predict the use of mobile technology by mobile professionals; (2) mobile technology needs to be available in a broad variety of use-situations; (3) users require basic communication and productivity-related functionality, in particular to support non-routine and supervisory task profiles; and (4) mobile technology can have considerable impacts on the job performance and on the personal lives of its users. Our findings have implications for the design, management, and research of mobile information systems.},

abstract = {When an emergency occurs within a building, it may be initially safer to send autonomous mobile nodes, instead of human responders, to explore the area and identify hazards and victims. Exploring all the area in the minimum amount of time and reporting back interesting findings to the human personnel outside the building is an essential part of rescue operations. Our assumptions are that the area map is unknown, there is no existing network infrastructure, long-range wireless communication is unreliable and nodes are not location-aware. We take into account these limitations, and propose an architecture consisting of both mobile nodes (robots, called agents) and stationary nodes (inexpensive smart devices, called tags). As agents enter the emergency area, they sprinkle tags within the space to label the environment with states. By reading and updating the state of the local tags, agents are able to coordinate indirectly with each other, without relying on direct agent-to-agent communication. In addition, tags wirelessly exchange local information with nearby tags to further assist agents in their exploration task. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, which exploits both tag-to-tag and agent-to-tag communication, outperforms previous algorithms that rely only on agent-to-tag communication.},

abstract = {Multiagent systems consist of multiple autonomous entities having different information and/or diverging interests. This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a computer science perspective, but also draws on ideas from game theory, economics, operations research, logic, philosophy and linguistics. It will serve as a reference for researchers in each of these fields, and be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. Emphasizing foundations, the authors offer a broad and rigorous treatment of their subject, with thorough presentations of distributed problem solving, non-cooperative game theory, multiagent communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, coalitional game theory, and logical theories of knowledge, belief, and other aspects of rational agency. For each topic, basic concepts are introduced, examples are given, proofs of key results are offered, and algorithmic considerations are examined. An appendix covers background material in probability theory, classical logic, Markov decision processes, and mathematical programming.},

abstract = {A commercial hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been modified for high-speed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) imaging using a short-pulse optical technology Nd:YVO(4) laser. The laser operating in frequency-tripled mode (lambda = 355 nm) is capable of delivering 1.5-ns pulses of energy at up to 8 muJ at 5-10 kHz and 3 muJ at 20 kHz. Experiments to improve beam homogeneity and reduce laser speckle by mechanical vibration of the fibre-optic laser delivery system are reported along with data from trial and tissue imaging experiments using the modified instrument. The laser appeared to yield best results for MALDI-MS imaging experiments when operating at repetition rates 5-10 kHz. Combining this with raster imaging allowed images of rat brain sections to be recorded in 37 min. Similarly, images of the distribution of peptides in "on-tissue" digest experiments from tumour tissues were recorded in 1 h and 30 min rather than the 8-h acquisition time previously used. A brief investigation of targeted protein analysis/imaging by multiple reaction monitoring experiments "on-tissue" is reported. A total of 26 transitions were recorded over a 3-s cycle time and images of abundant proteins were successfully recorded.},

This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a computer science perspective, but also draws on ideas from game theory, economics, operations research, logic, philosophy and linguistics. It will serve as a reference for researchers in each of these fields, and be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses.   Emphasizing foundations, the authors offer a broad and rigorous treatment of their subject, with thorough presentations of distributed problem solving, non-cooperative game theory, multiagent communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, coalitional game theory, and logical theories of knowledge, belief, and other aspects of rational agency. For each topic, basic concepts are introduced, examples are given, proofs of key results are offered, and algorithmic considerations are examined. An appendix covers background material in probability theory, classical logic, Markov decision processes, and mathematical programming.},

abstract = {The scale and diversity of interactions in current wide-area distributed programming environments, specially in Internet-based applications, point to the fact that there is no single solution for coordinating distributed applications. Instead, what is needed is the ability to easily build and combine different coordination abstractions. In this paper, we discuss the role of some language features, such as first-class function values, closures, and coroutines, in allowing different coordination mechanisms to be constructed out of a small set of communication primitives, and to be easily mixed and combined. Using the Lua programming language, we define a basic asynchronous primitive, which allows programming in a direct event-driven style with the syntax of function calls, and, based on this primitive, we build different well-known coordination abstractions for distributed computing.},

abstract = {Abstract This project focuses on developing a flapping-wing hovering insect using 3D-printed wings and mechanical parts. The use of 3D printing technology has greatly expanded the possibilities for wing design, allowing wing shapes to replicate those of real insects or virtually any other shape. It has also reduced the time of a wing design cycle to a matter of minutes. An ornithopter with a mass of 3.89 g has been constructed using the 3D printing technique and has demonstrated an 85-s passively stable untethered hovering flight.

abstract = {We investigate communication effects in the surveillance task and compare a communication vs. no-communication condition in a simulated environment using a modified version of an existing tracking algorithm. The modification not only allowed the collective to achieve a steady state of 100\% performance in most cases but also reduced both the influence of target-to-robot ratios and the size of the work radius as well as the performance variance. Communication solved an interference effect, rather than create one. The results are discussed from a perspective that focuses on messages that move the collective as a whole from an initial state to a solution state. Such messages provide information about the current task state, rather than information about the state of individual members or the location of attractors.},

Of the sensors available to a robotic agent, visual sensors provide information that is richer and mom complete than other sensors. In this paper we pment robust techniques for the derivation of depthmm feature points on a target\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}s surface and for the accurate and high-speed tracking of moving targets. We use these techniques in a system that operates with little or no a priori knowledge of the object- and camemrelated parameters to robustly determine such object-Elated parameters as velocity and depth. Such determination of extrinsic envimnmental parameters is essential for pegonning higher level tasks such as inspection, exploration, tracking, grasping, and collision-free motion planning. For both applications, we use the Minnesota Robotic Viiual Tracker (a single visual sensor mounted on the end-sector of a robotic manipulator combined with a real-time vision system) to automatically select feature points on su\#aces, to derive an estimate of the environmental parameter in question, and to supply a control vector based upon these estimates to guide the manipulator},

We feel that with the availability of newer, general, robust methods for computing optical flow, fast methods for estimating the focus of expansion (FOE), inexpensive cameras, and inertial information, robust, real-time solutions to this problem may be possible in the near future.

abstract = {An approach is presented for exploring an unknown, arbitrary surface in three-dimensional (30) space by a mobile robot. The main contributions are (1) an analysis of the capabilities a robot must possess and the trade-offs involved in the design of an exploration strategy, and (2) two provablycorrect exploration strategies that exploit these trade-offs and use visual sensors (e.g., cameras and range sensors) to plan the robot\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}s motion. No such analysis existed previously for the case of a robot moving freely in 30 space. The approach exploits the notion of the occlusion boundary, i.e., the points separating the visible from the occluded parts of an object. The occlusion boundary is a collection of curves that \^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\'{u}slide \^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o} over the surface when the robot\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}s position is continuously controlled, inducing the visibility of surface points over which they slide. The paths generated by our strategies force the occlusion boundary to slide over the entire surface. The strategies provide a basis for integrating motion planning and visual sensing under a common computational framework.},

Movements of the manipulator ptvduce displacements that are measured using a Sum-of-Squared Direrence (SSD) optical pOw The measured displacements are fed into the controller to alter the path of the manipulator and to e the depth estimate},

abstract = {Estimation of on-board camera's 3D motion has been a very important technique for autonomous robot navigation and other vision-based detecting and measuring tasks. Due to the nonlinearity and continuously changing background, on-board camera's 3D-motion analysis is very complex and always employs optical flows, line matching of road lane-marks or horizon tracking. It incurs a huge calculation cost and is very sensitive to noise. A new estimation method with the introduction of camera's focus of expansion (FOE) is presented in this paper. Using the motion features of the on-board camera and FOE, the camera 3D-motion parameters can theoretically be determined by our method using only three matching pairs, which make it fast and more efficient for real-time applications compared with the traditional methods. Experiments on simulation images and image sequences of real road scenes show the effectiveness and precision of the proposed approach. ,url},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for reducing odoniety errors caused by kinematic imperfections in wheeled mobile robots. A new velocity trajectory is proposed that compensates for orientation error due to acceleration constraints on motor controllers. According to this velocih, trajectoy, the wheel velocity of one out of two driven wheels may be changed by the traveled distance of the mobile robot. It is shown that a wheeled mobile robot can't move along a straight line exactly, even if kinematic imperfections are corrected perfectly, and this phenomenon is attributable to acceleration constraints on motor controllers. We experiment on a wheeled mobile robot with 2 d.o and discuss the results.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the robust tracking of features extracted from a sequence of images taken with an uncalibrated camera mounted on a mobile robot. Unlike most vision systems, the 3D structure of the observed objects is completely unknown. s, position-based visual servoing cannot be used. Similarly, one must be careful when using image-based visual servoing since the depths of the features are unknown. On the other hand, 2 1/2 D visual servoing can easily deal with unknown environments since it is only based on projective reconstruction. In order to obtain a good projective reconstruction for a safe vision-based control, we propose a multi-scale real-time approach to extract robust features. Experiments show that our algorithm can be used in robotics applications when images are noisy and uncontrolled perturbations can break the continuity of the robot motion.},

abstract = {Autonomous navigation requires a trajectory planning module making use of sensory information to derive safe and efficient motion strategies. This paper describes a basic function for such a module, namely the ability to use occlusion monitoring and interpretation as a basis for defining exploration trajectories. The first part of the paper describes an occlusion detection method based on binocular vision, which assumes that occlusions between the left and right views cause reprojection errors when images from one of the viewpoints are used to predict images from the other viewpoint. More specifically, occlusions are shown to cause forward or backward jumps in the displacement of reprojected points. In the second part of the paper, occlusions are dynamically monitored for exploration purposes. The exposed and occluded views are identified, and occlusions are reduced by moving the vehicle towards the exposed view. Occlusion width alone is used to determine occlusion equations, which can be solved to obtain depth information about the scene.},

The method applied simple 1D search directly to velocity field measurements of the changing image, for cases of general motion and constrained motion. In the case of general motion, the velocity field is derotated to cancel the velocity of the observed point at the image origin. In principle, a single moving closed contour which encircles the origin is sufficient to recover the focus of expansion. In practice, additional velocity measurements in the image may be incorporated in the computation, for improved robustness in the face of image noise and velocity field inaccuracies},

abstract = {A concept network of autonomous mobile robots intended to carry out tasks related to planetary space exploration is described. Many aspects of the system have been fashioned to make the transition from simulation to hardware as seamless as possible. Representative space exploration tasks are outlined followed by brief descriptions of the hardware and control. One specific task, deploying an array of sensors for network science, is used as an example. Technical challenges and preliminary experimental results are discussed. The benefits of using a simulator and hardware to develop controllers are found to be complementary},

Simple computations allow determining the direction from the estimated to the true 400FOE. The best estimate of the intersection of the so-called FOE constraint lines for each region gives the location of the FOE. Some analysis allows a confidence measure to be assigned to the information from each local region, in order to give more weighting to the most reliable data. Hence, the FOE can be located with more accuracy, even when the data from various local regions lack sufficient information},

abstract = {An approach is presented for exploring an unknown, arbitrary surface in three-dimensional (30) space by a mobile robot. The main contributions are (1) an analysis of the capabilities a robot must possess and the trade-offs involved in the design of an exploration strategy, and (2) two provablycorrect exploration strategies that exploit these trade-offs and use visual sensors (e.g., cameras and range sensors) to plan the robot\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}s motion. No such analysis existed previously for the case of a robot moving freely in 30 space. The approach exploits the notion of the occlusion boundary, i.e., the points separating the visible from the occluded parts of an object. The occlusion boundary is a collection of curves that \^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\'{u}slide \^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o} over the surface when the robot\^{a}\{\"{A}\}\{\"{o}\}\~{A}\{\~{N}\}\^{o}s position is continuously controlled, inducing the visibility of surface points over which they slide. The paths generated by our strategies force the occlusion boundary to slide over the entire surface. The strategies provide a basis for integrating motion planning and visual sensing under a common computational framework.},

Explicit communications, or messages sent directly between nodes, can be computationally inefficient and can result in performance degradation when communications fail. In implicit communications, messages are not passed directly from node to node. Instead, knowledge of team progress is gleamed through observations of the environment and other nodes’ actions. Approaches that use observation to infer state and intent to disperse mobile nodes for searching an unknown area are presented and compared to no communications and direct communications. Experimental results demonstrate that using observation to infer state and intent to disperse mobile nodes performs at least as well as non-communicative cooperation and in some cases direct communications.},

It is shown quantitatively, however, that even small rotations can significantly affect the computation of the focus of expansion (FOE). This is shown theoretically for the case in which the environment is a frontal plane, and also experimentally. Two algorithms are presented. One is an existing general motion algorithm. The second is a pure translational algorithm based on the weighted Hough transform. The depth results obtained using the second algorithm are reasonable, although they are not as good as those using general motion},

abstract = {Flexible operation of a robot in an uncalibrated environment requires the ability to recover unknown or partially known parameters of the workspace through sensing. Of the sensors available to a robotic agent, visual sensors provide information that is richer and more complete than other sensors. In this paper we present robust techniques for the derivation of depth from feature points on a target's surface and for the accurate and high-speed tracking of moving targets. We use these techniques in a system that operates with little or no a priori knowledge of the object-related parameters present in the environment. The system is designed under the Controlled Active Vision framework [I61 and robustly determines parameters such as velocity for tracking moving objects and depth maps of objects with unknown depths and surface structure. Such determination of extrinsic environmental parameters is essential for performing higher level tasks such as inspection, exploration, tracking, grasping, and collision-free motion planning. For both applications, we use the Minnesota Robotic Visual Tracker (a visual sensor mounted on the end-effector of a robotic manipulator combined with a real-time vision system) to automatically select feature points on surfaces, to derive an estimate of the environmental parameter in question, and to supply a control vector based upon these estimates to guide the manipulator.},
