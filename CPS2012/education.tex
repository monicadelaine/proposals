%¥	present a plan to integrate research outcomes into education and more broadly advance education in CPS;

Dr Anderson teaches an intelligent robotics course to senior-level undergraduates and first-year graduate students.  This course will be augmented to include software engineering in robotics and embedded systems.  The prevailing architectures will be presented in terms of their use of standard distributed software engineering paradigms (transparency, cohesion, synchronous vs asynchronous processing, and real-time issues at both the operating system and the applications level), use of standard tool chains to enable reuse and code generation within RDIS and frameworks.  Students will learn to evaluate performance in terms of jitter, latency, and maintainability.
