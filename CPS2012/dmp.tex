\section*{Data Management Plan}

We will publish our results in leading conferences and journals.
As is typical in the software engineering community, we will rigorously define our experimental procedures.
For example, for each case study we will provide the definition and context, including subject software systems, benchmarks, metrics, and the study setting.
In addition, we will document our research questions and hypotheses, our data collection and analysis procedures, results, and threats to validity.
We will provide access to our data files via online appendices.

We will release all software artifacts developed in association with this project under the \textit{BSD 3-Clause License} (the ``New BSD'' license) and will make them available via an appropriate outlet such as Google Project Hosting.

We will distribute annual reports via our web site.
